Java Messaging Through Pipes

This project demonstrates passing primitive data through pipes and object messages through pipes.
TA, TB, and TC classes pass data and messages amongst each other.
One thread is sending while the other is receiving.
Object messages must implement serializable and must later be deserialized.
